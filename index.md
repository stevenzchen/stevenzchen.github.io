Hello, I'm Steven Chen! I'm a grad student at Stanford studying computer science, with a focus in AI and computer vision. I completed my undergrad at UT Austin, under the [Turing Scholars][turing] CS honors program.

I've been fortunate to work multiple internships in software engineering and data science. Last year, I was a data science intern at Riot Games, where I worked on machine learning recommendation algorithms for League of Legends. In 2016, I interned at Google, where I worked on [Google Photos][photos] MapReduce frameworks. Before that, I worked at [RetailMeNot][rmn] on backend ranking algorithms.

I'm currently a TA for [CS102 Big Data][cs102], and have TA'd [CS161 Algorithms][cs161] the past two quarters. This summer, I will be interning at NVIDIA, working on deep learning for autonomous vehicles.

You can find my up-to-date **[resum√© here][resume]**. If you know me personally, connect with me on **[LinkedIn][linkedin]**!

In my free time, I like to travel, play guitar and saxophone, read, game, [appreciate architecture][arch], and watch Star Trek. Here are a couple of [my favorite][favorites] board games and video games, and here's my gigantic personal [Spotify playlist][spotify]. I'm also a [Google Local Guide][local], with over 1 million photo views on Google Maps!

I post about things I hope are interesting or useful on [my blog][blog], take a look below!
