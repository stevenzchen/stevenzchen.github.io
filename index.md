Hello, I'm Steven Chen. I am a Computer Science graduate student at Stanford, focusing on computer vision and artificial intelligence. I completed my undergrad at UT Austin, under the [Turing Scholars][turing] CS honors program. I will be graduating in mid-2019, and am looking forward to joining [Aurora Innovation][aurora] as a software engineer in the Machine Learning R&D team.

I was fortunate to have [Kristen Grauman][grauman] as my research advisor at UT. Our work on attributes was published in CVPR 2018 ([project page here][paper]). I am currently working with [Kayvon Fatahalian][kayvon] on performant deep neural networks for vision. Our recent work on efficient video inference is [here][jitnet].

I have been fortunate to learn from many internships. This summer, I worked at [NVIDIA][nvidia] on autonomous vehicle neural networks and system software. Previously, I worked at [Riot Games][riot] on machine learning recommendations for League of Legends, at Google on [Google Photos][photos] MapReduce APIs, and at [RetailMeNot][rmn] on ranking algorithms.

I am currently a teaching assistant for [CS102 Big Data][cs102] taught by [Dean Jennifer Widom][widom]. I was a teaching assistant for [CS230 Deep Learning][cs230], taught by [Kian Katanforoosh][kian] and [Andrew Ng][andrew], as well as [CS161 Algorithms][cs161] taught by [Mary Wootters][wootters] and [Leonidas Guibas][guibas].

You can find my **[resum√© here][resume]**. If you know me personally, connect with me on **[LinkedIn][linkedin]**.

In my free time, I like to read, dance, travel, and play strategy games. I enjoy [touring architecture][arch], and I like to drive and keep up with the auto industry. I'm also an [Google Local Guide][local] reviewer, with over 75,000 review and 2.3 million photo views on Google Maps.
