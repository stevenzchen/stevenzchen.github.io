Hello, I'm Steven! I am a Stanford Computer Science graduate student, focusing on computer vision and performant systems. I completed my undergrad at UT Austin, under the [Turing Scholars][turing] CS honors program. I will be graduating in 2019, and am looking forward to joining [Aurora Innovation][aurora] as a software engineer working on Machine Learning R&D.

I was fortunate to have [Kristen Grauman][grauman] as my research advisor at UT. Our work on visual attributes was published in CVPR 2018 ([project page here][paper]). I am currently advised by [Kayvon Fatahalian][kayvon]: our recent work on efficient video inference can be found [here][jitnet].

I have been fortunate to learn from many internships. Last summer, I worked at [NVIDIA][nvidia] on autonomous vehicle neural networks and systems. Previously, I worked at [Riot Games][riot] on machine learning recommendations for League of Legends, at Google on [Google Photos][photos] MapReduce, and at [RetailMeNot][rmn] on ranking algorithms.

I am currently a teaching assistant for [CS230 Deep Learning][cs230], taught by [Kian Katanforoosh][kian] and [Andrew Ng][andrew]. I was a teaching assistant for [CS102 Big Data][cs102] taught by [Dean Jennifer Widom][widom], as well as [CS161 Algorithms][cs161] taught by [Mary Wootters][wootters] and [Leonidas Guibas][guibas].

My **[resum√© is here][resume]**. If you know me personally, feel free to connect with me on **[LinkedIn][linkedin]**.

In my free time, I like to read, dance, travel, and play strategy and team games. I enjoy [thinking about architecture][arch], and I like to keep up with the latest in the auto industry. I'm also an avid [Google Local Guide][local] reviewer, with over 2.5 million photo views on Google Maps, as well as the occasional amateur [Wikipedia editor][wikipedia].
