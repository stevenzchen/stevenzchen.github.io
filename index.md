Hello, I'm Steven Chen. I'm currently a grad student at Stanford studying Computer Science, with a focus in artificial intelligence and computer vision. I completed my undergrad at the University of Texas at Austin, under the [Turing Scholars][turing] CS honors program.

I've been fortunate to work multiple internships in software engineering and data science. My most recent internship was at Riot Games in 2017 as a data scientist, where I worked on machine learning recommenders for League of Legends. In 2016, I interned at Google, where I worked on [Google Photos][photos] MapReduce frameworks. Before that, I worked at [RetailMeNot][rmn] on backend algorithms.

You can find my updated **[resum√© here][resume]**.

In my free time, I like to travel, play guitar and saxophone, game, [marvel at architecture][arch], and watch Star Trek. Here are a couple of [my favorite][favorites] board games and PC games. I'm also a [Google Local Guide][local].

I post about things I hope are interesting or useful on [my blog][blog], take a look below!
