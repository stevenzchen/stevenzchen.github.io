Hello, I'm Steven! I am currently a software engineer on the Perception team at [Aurora][aurora], working on autonomous vehicles. I graduated from Stanford in 2019 with a Masters in Computer Science, where I focused on computer vision, machine learning, and performant systems. I completed my undergrad at UT Austin, under the [Turing Scholars][turing] CS honors program.

I was advised by [Kayvon Fatahalian][kayvon] at Stanford: our work on efficient video inference was published in ICCV 2019 and can be found [here][jitnet]. I was fortunate to have [Kristen Grauman][grauman] as my research advisor at UT. Our research on visual attributes was published in CVPR 2018 ([project page here][paper]).

I had four internships during undergraduate and graduate school. In 2018, I worked at [NVIDIA][nvidia] on autonomous vehicle neural networks and systems. Previously, I worked at [Riot Games][riot] on machine learning recommendations for League of Legends, at Google on [Google Photos][photos] MapReduce, and at [RetailMeNot][rmn] on ranking algorithms.

At Stanford, I was a teaching assistant for [CS230 Deep Learning][cs230], taught by [Kian Katanforoosh][kian] and [Andrew Ng][andrew], [CS102 Big Data][cs102] taught by [Dean Jennifer Widom][widom], as well as [CS161 Algorithms][cs161] taught by [Mary Wootters][wootters] and [Leonidas Guibas][guibas].

My **[resum√© is here][resume]**. If you know me personally, feel free to connect with me on **[LinkedIn][linkedin]**.

In my free time, I like to read, dance, travel, and play strategy and team games. I enjoy [thinking about architecture][arch], and I like to keep up with the latest in the auto industry. I'm an avid [Google Local Guide][local] reviewer, with over 3 million photo views and 100 thousand review reads on Google Maps, as well as the occasional amateur [Wikipedia editor][wikipedia].
