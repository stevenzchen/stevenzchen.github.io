Hello, I'm Steven Chen! I'm a Masters student at Stanford studying computer science, with a focus on computer vision and AI. I completed my undergrad at UT Austin, under the [Turing Scholars][turing] CS honors program.

I am passionate about applying computer vision and AI solutions to help improve people's lives at a large scale. I'm particularly interested in autonomous vehicles and their potential to save lives, reduce traffic congestion, and cut emissions. 

I was fortunate to have [Professor Kristen Grauman][grauman] as my research advisor at UT. Our work on visual attributes was recently published in CVPR 2018 ([paper here][paper]).

I've had the opportunity to learn from several internships in engineering and data science. Recently, I worked at [Riot Games][riot] on machine learning recommendation algorithms for League of Legends. I previously worked at Google on [Google Photos][photos] MapReduce APIs, and at [RetailMeNot][rmn] on ranking algorithms. This summer, I'm looking forward to interning at [NVIDIA][nvidia], where I will be working on deep learning for autonomous vehicles. 

I'm currently a teaching assistant for [CS102 Big Data][cs102] at Stanford, and TA'd [CS161 Algorithms][cs161] previously.

You can find my up-to-date **[resum√© here][resume]**. If you know me personally, connect with me on **[LinkedIn][linkedin]**!

In my free time, I like to travel, play guitar, read, play strategy games, and watch Star Trek. I enjoy [appreciating architecture][arch], and I like to drive and keep up with advances in the auto industry. Here are a couple of [my favorite games][favorites]. I'm also a [Google Local Guide][local], with over 1 million photo views on Google Maps!

I post ideas I hope are interesting or useful on [my blog][blog], take a look below.
